**Automatic Browser Opening Rules**

1. Execution Requirements:
   - Must be run after docker-compose.yml creation
   - Requires curl in containers for health checks
   - Handles Linux/macOS/Windows via OSTYPE detection

2. Health Check Logic:
   - Waits for HTTP 200 responses from both services
   - Uses docker-compose exec for container checks
   - Includes 2-second retry intervals

3. Browser Handling:
   - Opens Open WebUI on port 8080
   - Opens Uptime Kuma on port 3001
   - Falls back to manual URL display
