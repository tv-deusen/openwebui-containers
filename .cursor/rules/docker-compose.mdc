**Docker Compose Configuration Rules for AI Stack**

1. Mandatory Services:
   - ollama (with NVIDIA GPU support)
   - open-webui (no authentication)
   - uptime-kuma (monitoring both services)

2. Network Requirements:
   - Create shared 'ai-network' bridge network
   - All services must connect to ai-network

3. Volume Management:
   - Persistent volumes for all stateful services
   - Map ollama volume to /root/.ollama
   - Map open-webui volume to /app/backend/data

4. GPU Configuration:
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     resources:
       reservations:
         devices:
           - driver: nvidia
             count: 1
             capabilities: [gpu]
