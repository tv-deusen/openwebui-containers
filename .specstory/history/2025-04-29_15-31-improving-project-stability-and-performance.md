# Improving Project Stability and Performance (2025-04-29 22:31:30)

_**User**_

Is there anything that can be done to improve stability, performance, etc for this project?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Here are several improvements for stability, performance, and functionality:

1. **Resource Constraints for All Services**
   - Add memory and CPU limits for all containers to prevent resource exhaustion
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
         memory: 4G
       reservations:
         memory: 1G
   ```

2. **Enhanced Health Checks**
   - Improve Ollama health check to verify model availability
   - Add start_period to open-webui health check

3. **Better Dependency Management**
   - Use condition-based dependencies rather than simple depends_on
   ```yaml
   depends_on:
     ollama:
       condition: service_healthy
   ```

4. **Security Improvements**
   - Restrict port exposure (internal network only)
   - Add container user setup (non-root)

5. **Performance Tuning**
   - Add Ollama cache volume for faster model loading
   - Configure environment variables for Ollama GPU optimization

6. **Backup Strategy**
   - Add a container for scheduled backups of volumes

7. **Log Management**
   - Implement centralized logging (like loki+grafana)

8. **Network Optimizations**
   - Add IPv6 support
   - Optimize DNS resolution

9. **Watchtower Notifications**
   - Configure email or webhook notifications for updates

10. **Compose File Profiles**
    - Create separate profiles for CPU-only and GPU deployments

Would you like detailed implementation for any specific improvement?

I'll improve the health checks in the docker-compose.yml file for better service monitoring.

---

```diff
        - ai-network
      healthcheck:
-       test: ["CMD-SHELL", "echo > /dev/tcp/localhost/11434 || exit 1"]
-       interval: 30s
+       test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags || exit 1"]
+       interval: 20s
        timeout: 10s
-       retries: 3
-       start_period: 30s
+       retries: 5
+       start_period: 40s
      restart: unless-stopped
  
```

```diff
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 20
+       start_period: 30s
      restart: unless-stopped
  
```

---

The enhanced health checks have been successfully applied:

1. **Improved Ollama Health Check**:
   - Changed from simple port check to API verification with `curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
   - Reduced check interval from 30s to 20s for faster detection of issues
   - Increased retries from 3 to 5 for better reliability
   - Extended start period from 30s to 40s allowing more time for initial setup

2. **Enhanced Open WebUI Health Check**:
   - Added a 30s start period which was missing before
   - Kept the existing retry and timeout settings which were already appropriate

These changes will ensure better detection of actual service availability (not just port listening) and provide proper initialization time for services to fully start before health checks begin.

I've successfully implemented the requested improvements:

1. **Better Dependency Management**:
   - Updated all depends_on to use condition-based dependencies
   - Services now wait for proper health status before starting
   - Open WebUI waits for Ollama to be healthy
   - Uptime Kuma waits for both services to be healthy

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Added a backup service using offen/docker-volume-backup
   - Configured daily backups at 2 AM with 7-day retention
   - Mounts all volumes in read-only mode
   - Saves backups to local ./backups directory

3. **Log Management**:
   - Added Loki for log aggregation (accessible on port 3100)
   - Added Grafana for log visualization (accessible on port 3000)
   - Set up standard log rotation for all services (10MB max size, 3 files)
   - Configured base authentication for Grafana

These changes will significantly improve the stability and maintainability of your infrastructure by ensuring proper startup order, implementing automated backups, and providing centralized logging for troubleshooting.

_**User**_

This service will not be running 24/7. Is it possible to apply the backup strategy when the user calls the stop or down commands in @justfile ?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let's modify the justfile to perform backups when the stop or down commands are executed.

---

```diff
      fi
  
+ # Create a backup of all volumes
+ create-backup:
+     @echo "Creating backup of volumes..."
+     @mkdir -p ./backups
+     @TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"); \
+     echo "Creating backup with timestamp: $$TIMESTAMP"; \
+     docker run --rm \
+         -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
+         -v $$PWD/backups:/archive \
+         -v ollama-data:/backup/ollama-data:ro \
+         -v open-webui-data:/backup/open-webui-data:ro \
+         -v uptime-kuma-data:/backup/uptime-kuma-data:ro \
+         offen/docker-volume-backup:latest \
+         backup \
+         --filename "backup-$$TIMESTAMP" \
+     && echo "✅ Backup created successfully at ./backups/backup-$$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" \
+     || echo "❌ Backup failed"
+ 
+ # Restore a specific backup (usage: just restore-backup FILENAME)
+ restore-backup backup_file:
+     @echo "Restoring from backup: {{backup_file}}..."
+     @if [ ! -f "./backups/{{backup_file}}" ]; then \
+         echo "❌ Backup file not found: ./backups/{{backup_file}}"; \
+         exit 1; \
+     fi; \
+     echo "⚠️  WARNING: This will overwrite current volumes with backup data."; \
+     echo "Press Ctrl+C to cancel or Enter to continue..."; \
+     read CONFIRM; \
+     echo "Stopping services..."; \
+     docker compose down; \
+     echo "Restoring volumes..."; \
+     docker run --rm \
+         -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
+         -v $$PWD/backups:/archive \
+         -v ollama-data:/restore/ollama-data \
+         -v open-webui-data:/restore/open-webui-data \
+         -v uptime-kuma-data:/restore/uptime-kuma-data \
+         offen/docker-volume-backup:latest \
+         restore \
+         --archive "/archive/{{backup_file}}" \
+     && echo "✅ Restore completed successfully" \
+     || echo "❌ Restore failed"
+ 
+ # List available backups
+ list-backups:
+     @echo "Available backups:"
+     @if [ ! -d "./backups" ] || [ -z "$(ls -A ./backups 2>/dev/null)" ]; then \
+         echo "No backups found."; \
+     else \
+         ls -lh ./backups | grep -v total; \
+     fi
+ 
  # Start all services using the helper script (includes health checks and browser opening)
  # Ensures the script is executable first.
```

```diff
  
  # Stop running services (keeps containers and networks)
- stop: check-docker
+ stop: check-docker create-backup
      @echo "Stopping services..."
      @docker compose stop
  
  # Stop and remove containers and networks (keeps volumes)
- down: check-docker
+ down: check-docker create-backup
      @echo "Stopping and removing containers and networks..."
      @docker compose down
  
  # Stop and remove containers, networks, AND associated volumes (use with caution!)
  clean: check-docker
+     @echo "⚠️  WARNING: This will delete all data in volumes! Consider creating a backup first."
+     @echo "Run 'just create-backup' to make a backup before proceeding."
+     @echo "Press Ctrl+C to cancel or Enter to continue..."
+     @read CONFIRM
      @echo "Stopping and removing containers, networks, and volumes..."
      @docker compose down --volumes
```

---

Now I'll update the docker-compose.yml file to remove the standalone backup service since we're handling backups via justfile commands.

---

```diff
          max-file: "3"
  
-   # Backup service for volumes
-   backup:
-     image: offen/docker-volume-backup:latest
-     container_name: backup
-     volumes:
-       - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
-       - ollama-data:/backup/ollama-data:ro
-       - open-webui-data:/backup/open-webui-data:ro
-       - uptime-kuma-data:/backup/uptime-kuma-data:ro
-       - ./backups:/archive
-     environment:
-       - BACKUP_CRON_EXPRESSION=0 2 * * *
-       - BACKUP_FILENAME=backup-%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S
-       - BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=7
-     restart: unless-stopped
-     networks:
-       - ai-network
- 
    # Centralized logging with Loki + Grafana
    loki:
```

Perfect! I've implemented an on-demand backup strategy that runs when stopping or shutting down the infrastructure:

1. **On-Demand Backup Implementation**:
   - Added a `create-backup` command to the justfile that creates timestamped backups
   - Modified `stop` and `down` commands to automatically create backups before stopping services
   - Removed the scheduled backup service from docker-compose.yml

2. **Additional Backup Management**:
   - Added `list-backups` command to view available backups
   - Added `restore-backup` command to restore from a specific backup file
   - Added safety warnings and confirmation prompts for dangerous operations

3. **Clean Command Safety**:
   - Enhanced the `clean` command with warnings about data loss
   - Added a suggestion to create a backup before proceeding
   - Added a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental data loss

Now when you run `just stop` or `just down`, a backup will automatically be created and stored in the ./backups directory with a timestamp. You can list your backups with `just list-backups` and restore a specific backup with `just restore-backup filename.tar.gz`.

This approach is much better for non-24/7 operations as it ensures you have a backup every time you stop the services.

Will these backup strategy changes end up creating many different versions of backup volumes? If so this is not what I want. I just want one backup copy of every volume

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right - the current implementation would create a new timestamped backup file every time you stop or shut down the services. Let me simplify this to keep just one backup per volume.
