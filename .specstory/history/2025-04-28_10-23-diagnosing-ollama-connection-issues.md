# Diagnosing Ollama Connection Issues (2025-04-28 17:23:18)

_**User**_

When trying to manage the Ollama instance through the Open WebUI admin panel I see this error in the browser console:

What part of the Compose configuration could be causing this issue? What can I do to diagnose the connection issue between WebUI and Ollama?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The error suggests a communication issue between Open WebUI and Ollama. Looking at your configuration:

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**:
   - Your current setting is `OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://ollama:11434` 
   - The 500 error on `/ollama/api/tags/0` indicates the proxy forwarding is failing

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The WebUI might be trying to proxy requests through `/ollama/` path but failing
   - Ollama might be running but not responding correctly to API requests
   - Network connectivity between containers might be affected

Here's how to diagnose and fix:

1. **Check Ollama Accessibility**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it open-webui curl -v http://ollama:11434/api/tags
   ```

2. **Verify Ollama API**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama curl -v http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```

3. **Try Alternative Environment Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434
     - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434
   ```

4. **Check Logs for Clues**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs open-webui | grep -i error
   docker-compose logs ollama | grep -i error
   ```

5. **Verify Network Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   docker network inspect ai-network
   ```

The most likely issue is either the environment variable configuration or a connectivity problem between containers on the ai-network.

See the output of the inspection of ai-network

_**Assistant**_



---

The issue is that the `ai-network` does not exist, which is why your containers can't communicate. This explains the 500 error when Open WebUI tries to connect to Ollama.

To fix this:

1. Fully recreate your setup:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Verify network creation:
   ```bash
   docker network ls | grep ai-network
   ```

3. If the network still doesn't appear, check for Docker Compose version issues:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

4. Try manually creating the network:
   ```bash
   docker network create ai-network
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Check if your service names match exactly between the error message and compose file (case sensitivity matters)

The key issue is that without the `ai-network`, the containers can't communicate using the service names as hostnames, breaking the WebUI's connection to Ollama.

---

_**User**_

Should there be something added to the @justfile and/or @start-services.sh to bring up the network?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, there seems to be an issue with network creation. The error "network ai-network not found" suggests that either the network isn't being created or it's using a different name than expected.

The problem is likely with how docker-compose is being called. Here's what to add:

1. In `start-services.sh`, modify the docker-compose commands to explicitly include the project name:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for NVIDIA GPU
if command -v nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then
    echo "NVIDIA GPU detected"
    nvidia-smi
else
    echo "WARNING: NVIDIA GPU not detected. GPU acceleration will not be available."
fi

# Start services
echo "Starting services with docker-compose..."
docker-compose -p mylittlellm down
docker-compose -p mylittlellm up -d

# Rest of the script remains the same...
```

2. Make the same change in the `justfile` for consistency:

```
# Stop running services (keeps containers and networks)
stop:
    @echo "Stopping services..."
    @docker-compose -p mylittlellm stop

# Stop and remove containers and networks (keeps volumes)
down:
    @echo "Stopping and removing containers and networks..."
    @docker-compose -p mylittlellm down

# Other commands should also be updated to include -p mylittlellm
```

This ensures the project name is used consistently, which helps docker-compose create and identify the network correctly.

What effect would providing the project name as an argument to the calls to docker-compose in the @justfile 

---

_**Assistant**_

Using `-p mylittlellm` tells Docker Compose to override its default project name (normally derived from your working-directory) and use “mylittlellm” instead.  That has two side-effects:

1. Resource naming  
   - All containers, networks, and volumes get prefixed with `mylittlellm_`.  
   - Your `ai-network` (which you defined without an explicit `name:`) will actually be created as `mylittlellm_ai-network`.  
   - If you inspect or reference just `ai-network`, it won’t be found.

2. Command scoping  
   - Every `docker-compose up/down/logs` call targets the same project.  
   - If you mix calls with and without `-p`, you’ll wind up spinning up two “projects” side-by-side that don’t share the same network or containers.

To fix your 500 error (which stems from WebUI and Ollama ending up on different networks):

• Either  
  – Add `-p mylittlellm` consistently to **both** your `justfile` **and** `start-services.sh`, so everything lives in `mylittlellm_ai-network`,  
  – Then inspect with `docker network inspect mylittlellm_ai-network`.  

• Or explicitly name the network in your Compose file so it’s always `ai-network` regardless of project name:
```yaml
networks:
  ai-network:
    name: ai-network
    driver: bridge
```  
That way you can leave your scripts alone and still refer to `ai-network` directly.

_**User**_

So if I follow this suggestion: • Or explicitly name the network in your Compose file so it’s always ai-network regardless of project name:

I don't need to include the -p mylittlellm argument in @justfile and @start-services.sh ?

---

_**Assistant**_

That’s right—once you explicitly give the network a fixed name in your Compose file, you can drop the `-p mylittlellm` flags and Docker Compose will still create (and attach all services to) a network called exactly `ai-network`.  

Here’s the one‐line change in `docker-compose.yml` you need under `networks`:

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
networks:
  ai-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: ai-network
```

With that in place:

• You don’t need `-p mylittlellm` in your `justfile` or `start-services.sh` for the network to be called `ai-network`.  
• Your containers will all join the same `ai-network` and can talk to each other by service name.  
• (You may still get project-based prefixes on containers/volumes if you ever do use `-p`, but it no longer matters for the network.)

_**User**_

Now make @start-services.sh and @justfile  consistent by not specifying the project name with the -p flag, since I gave the network a specific name.

      @echo "Stopping services..."

      # Note: This bypasses the start-services.sh health checks and browser opening.
      # Run 'just start' afterwards if you need that behavior.
```

```diff
  logs:
      @echo "Following logs for all services..."
-     @docker-compose -p mylittlellm logs -f

  logs-service service:
      @echo "Following logs for service '{{ service }}'..."
-     @docker-compose -p mylittlellm logs -f {{ service }}
+     @docker-compose logs -f {{ service }}
  
  # List running services and their status
  status:
      @echo "Checking service status..."

  # Pull the latest images for all services
  pull:
      @echo "Pulling latest images..."

```diff
  # Start services
  echo "Starting services with docker-compose..."
- docker-compose -p mylittlellm down
- docker-compose -p mylittlellm up -d

+ docker-compose up -d
  
  echo "Waiting for services to be ready..."
```

---

I’ve removed the `-p mylittlellm` flags from both the `justfile` and `start-services.sh`. All `docker-compose` commands now use the default project name and your explicitly named `ai-network`. Let me know if you need anything else!

_**User**_

I am also using Docker Compose version v2.34.0-desktop.1 so I believe the project files should be using "docker compose" rather than the legacy "docker-compose"

All `docker-compose` calls have been replaced with the Docker v2 plugin syntax `docker compose` in both the `justfile` and `start-services.sh`. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
