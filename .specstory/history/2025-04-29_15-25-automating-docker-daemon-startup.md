# Automating Docker Daemon Startup (2025-04-29 22:25:25)

_**User**_

instead of erroring out here, can the docker daemon just be started instead?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can attempt to start the Docker daemon automatically if it is not running, rather than just erroring out. The approach depends on the OS:

- On most Linux systems, Docker is managed by systemd (`systemctl start docker`).
- On macOS, Docker is usually started via the Docker Desktop app (`open -a Docker`).
- On Windows, it’s typically started via Docker Desktop as well, but the command is different.

You can update your `check-docker` recipe in the `justfile` to try to start Docker automatically based on the OS. Here’s a robust way to do it:

```make
check-docker:
    @if ! docker info &> /dev/null; then \
        echo "Docker daemon is not running. Attempting to start it..."; \
        if [ "$(uname)" = "Linux" ]; then \
            sudo systemctl start docker; \
        elif [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then \
            open -a Docker; \
        else \
            echo "Please start Docker manually for your OS."; \
        fi; \
        sleep 3; \
        if ! docker info &> /dev/null; then \
            echo "ERROR: Docker daemon could not be started. Please start Docker and try again."; \
            exit 1; \
        fi; \
    fi
```

**What this does:**
- Checks if Docker is running.
- If not, tries to start it (using `systemctl` for Linux, `open -a Docker` for macOS).
- Waits a few seconds, then checks again.
- If Docker still isn’t running, it errors out.

Would you like me to update your `justfile` with this logic?

Now that the docker daemon gets started in the justfile it's redundant to check in @start-services.sh right?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, since the Docker daemon is now being checked and started in the `justfile`, it is indeed redundant to perform the same check in the `start-services.sh` script. You can safely remove that section from `start-services.sh`.

Here’s how you can update `start-services.sh` to remove the Docker daemon check:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for NVIDIA GPU
if command -v nvidia-smi &>/dev/null; then
  echo "NVIDIA GPU detected"
  nvidia-smi
else
  echo "WARNING: NVIDIA GPU not detected. GPU acceleration will not be available."
fi

# Start services
echo "Starting services with docker compose..."
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

echo "Waiting for services to be ready..."

# Wait for Ollama to be ready
echo "Checking Ollama health..."
until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://ollama:11434/api/tags >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  echo "Waiting for Ollama to be ready..."
  sleep 2
done
echo "Ollama is ready!"

# Wait for Open WebUI to be ready
echo "Checking Open WebUI health..."
until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://open-webui:8080 >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  echo "Waiting for Open WebUI to be ready..."
  sleep 2
done
echo "Open WebUI is ready!"

# Wait for Uptime Kuma to be ready
echo "Checking Uptime Kuma health..."
until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://uptime-kuma:3001/health >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  echo "Waiting for Uptime Kuma to be ready..."
  sleep 2
done
echo "Uptime Kuma is ready!"

# Open browser based on OS type
echo "Opening services in browser..."

open_browser() {
  local url=$1
  if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu"* ]]; then
    xdg-open "$url" &>/dev/null || (echo "Could not open browser automatically. Please visit: $url")
  elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
    open "$url" &>/dev/null || (echo "Could not open browser automatically. Please visit: $url")
  elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "msys" || "$OSTYPE" == "win"* ]]; then
    start "$url" &>/dev/null || (echo "Could not open browser automatically. Please visit: $url")
  else
    echo "Could not detect OS for browser opening. Please visit: $url"
  fi
}

echo "All services are ready!"
echo "-------------------------------------"
echo "Open WebUI: http://localhost:8080"
echo "Uptime Kuma: http://localhost:3001"
echo "-------------------------------------"

# Open services in browser
open_browser "http://localhost:8080"
open_browser "http://localhost:3001"

echo "Services started successfully!"
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Removed the Docker daemon check and start logic from `start-services.sh`.

Would you like me to make this change in your `start-services.sh` file?
