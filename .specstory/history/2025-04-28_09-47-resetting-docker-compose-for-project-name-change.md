# Resetting Docker-Compose for Project Name Change (2025-04-28 16:47:14)

_**User**_

I added a project-name after already initializing the application infrastructure and now there is issues when calling docker-compose up. What can I do to basically clear out the project and rebuild from a clean slate 

---

_**Assistant**_

To completely tear down everything Docker‐Compose created (containers, networks, volumes, images, orphans) and start over from zero, you can do something like:

1. Stop & remove all Compose resources (containers, networks, volumes, orphans, images):  
   ```bash
   # If you’re using the old docker‐compose binary:
   docker-compose down \
     --remove-orphans \
     --volumes \
     --rmi all

   # Or with the newer Docker CLI plugin:
   docker compose down \
     --remove-orphans \
     --volumes \
     --rmi all
   ```
   • `--remove-orphans` will clean up containers defined in the old project but no longer in your yml  
   • `--volumes` removes all named volumes (ollama-data, open-webui-data, uptime-kuma-data)  
   • `--rmi all` deletes any images built/pulled by that Compose file  

2. Prune any leftovers (networks, volumes, images not tied to a container):  
   ```bash
   docker network prune -f
   docker volume prune -f
   docker system prune -f   # (this also prunes dangling images)
   ```
   This will make sure there’s no old `ai-network` or other stale resources hanging around.

3. (Optional) If you want to remove *every* volume/image on the host, you can do:  
   ```bash
   docker system prune --all --volumes -f
   ```

4. Rebuild & bring everything back up:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
   or  
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

After that you’ll have a completely fresh set of:
-  containers (ollama, open-webui, uptime-kuma)  
-  named volumes (newly created)  
-  bridge network (`ai-network`)  

—and your project name change in `docker-compose.yml` will take effect cleanly.

Would it be better to use the just start command rather than this `   docker compose up -d --build`

---

_**Assistant**_

Using `just start` is almost always the better choice versus hand-typing:

• It runs your GPU pre-flight check, so you get a warning if `nvidia-smi` isn’t available.  
• It guarantees the `start-services.sh` helper is executable.  
• It tears down any old containers (`docker-compose down`) before bringing them back up, so you don’t end up with zombie or orphaned containers.  
• It includes rolling health checks for Ollama, Open WebUI and Uptime Kuma—and only continues once each is truly ready.  
• It even opens your browser for you, with cross-OS support.

By contrast, `docker compose up -d --build` will rebuild and start your services, but you lose:

  – the GPU check  
  – the clean down/up cycle  
  – the built-in health-wait loops  
  – the automatic browser pop-ups

If you’re just tinkering with image builds and don’t care about waits or browsers, invoking `docker compose up -d --build` directly is fine. But for a repeatable, “it just works” startup—especially if you want to guarantee proper ordering and readiness—stick with:

    just start

If you ever need to force-rebuild without waiting or browser-opening, there’s also:

    just rebuild

which does `docker-compose down` then `up -d --build --force-recreate` and skips the health-check script.
