# Understanding Docker Compose and Script Execution (2025-04-28 09:19:28)

_**User**_

when running `docker compose up` it appears that line 49 onward in @start-services.sh is not executed. How come?

---

_**Assistant**_

When you run  
```bash
docker compose up
```  
all you’re doing is telling Docker Compose to read your `docker-compose.yml` and bring up the containers. It has absolutely no idea about your `start-services.sh` wrapper script, so none of the code in that script (lines 49 – end or anywhere else) ever runs.

Your `start-services.sh` is a *local* orchestration script that:

  • does a `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`  
  • loops until each container’s HTTP check passes  
  • then prints URLs and opens them in your browser  

If you just type `docker compose up` at the shell prompt, you’ll never invoke any of that “wait for healthchecks” or “open_browser” logic.

To get the behavior in `start-services.sh` you have to actually run it:

  chmod +x start-services.sh  
  ./start-services.sh  

or  

  bash start-services.sh  

If you want Docker Compose itself to trigger those same steps, you’d either need to:

  • wrap your script in a tiny “init” service in the YAML, or  
  • turn it into a Makefile or shell alias that always calls your script instead of calling `docker compose` directly.  

But there is no magic in Compose that will auto-execute a sibling `.sh` file unless you explicitly hook it in.

From what you mentioned:

• wrap your script in a tiny “init” service in the YAML, or
• turn it into a Makefile or shell alias that always calls your script instead of calling docker compose directly.
But there is no magic in Compose that will auto-execute a sibling .sh file unless you explicitly hook it in.

Between the current way in @start-services.sh and these other 2 options, which one is the most idiomatic and robust?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, let's break down the options for managing the startup process:

1.  **Current `start-services.sh`:**
    *   **Pros:** Explicit, easy to understand for anyone familiar with shell scripting. Keeps the orchestration logic (waiting, browser opening, GPU check) separate from the declarative service definitions in `docker-compose.yml`. Handles OS-specific browser opening correctly on the host machine. Allows pre-flight checks (`nvidia-smi`) *before* even attempting `docker-compose up`.
    *   **Cons:** Requires the user to know they *must* run this script instead of the standard `docker-compose up`. The waiting logic somewhat duplicates the purpose of Docker Compose's built-in `depends_on` and `healthcheck` features (though your script uses `curl` which might be a more specific check).

2.  **"Init" Service in `docker-compose.yml`:**
    *   **Pros:** Theoretically integrates the startup flow into a single `docker-compose up` command.
    *   **Cons:** This is generally **not idiomatic** for Docker Compose. Compose is designed for defining and linking *long-running services*. Adding a short-lived container just to run host-level commands (like checking external dependencies or opening a host browser) is awkward. It breaks the containerization model, would require complex volume mounts or network settings to interact with the host OS (like `xdg-open`), and largely replicates functionality better handled outside Compose or by its built-in features. **This is the least robust and most complex option.**

3.  **Makefile or Shell Alias/Function:**
    *   **Pros:** Provides a standard entry point (`make start`, `start-ai-stack`) that hides the implementation detail (running the script). Keeps the `docker-compose.yml` clean and focused on service definitions. Still allows the core `docker-compose up` to function independently if needed. Makefiles are common for managing build/run tasks in projects.
    *   **Cons:** Adds a small layer of abstraction (the Makefile or shell config).

**Conclusion:**

*   **Most Idiomatic (for Compose):** The most idiomatic approach *from Docker Compose's perspective* is to rely solely on `depends_on` and `healthcheck` within the `docker-compose.yml` to manage service startup order and readiness. Any *additional* orchestration (like complex readiness checks beyond a simple port check, or user-facing actions like opening browsers) is typically handled externally.
*   **Most Robust & Practical (for your use case):** Your current approach using **`start-services.sh` is actually quite robust and practical for a development environment helper script.** It correctly separates the concerns:
    *   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the *what* (services, networks, volumes).
    *   `start-services.sh`: Defines the *how* (the specific steps to bring it up conveniently for *you*, including checks and browser opening).

Using a **Makefile** to wrap the call to `./start-services.sh` would be a slightly more standardized way to provide a simple command (`make start`), but the core logic remains in the shell script, which is appropriate here.

**Recommendation:** Stick with your `start-services.sh` script. It's clear, effectively accomplishes the goal, and correctly performs host-specific actions (GPU check, browser opening) outside the container environment. If you want a cleaner invocation, wrap the `./start-services.sh` call in a Makefile target. Avoid the "init" service approach.

Could something like @https://github.com/casey/just  be useful in this project?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, `just` could potentially be a useful addition to this project, acting as a more structured command runner, similar to how `make` is often used but with simpler syntax and behavior [[Source: casey/just GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just)].

Here's how it could fit in and the potential benefits:

1.  **Replacing Direct Script Execution:** Instead of remembering to run `./start-services.sh`, you could create a `justfile` in your project root:

    ```justfile
    # justfile

    # Start all services with health checks and browser opening
    start:
        @chmod +x ./start-services.sh
        @./start-services.sh

    # Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes
    stop:
        @docker-compose down --volumes

    # View logs for all services
    logs:
        @docker-compose logs -f

    # View logs for a specific service (e.g., just logs ollama)
    logs-service service:
        @docker-compose logs -f {{service}}

    # Rebuild images and start
    rebuild: stop
        @docker-compose up -d --build

    # Default command when running 'just'
    default: start
    ```

2.  **Benefits:**
    *   **Standard Interface:** Provides a consistent way to run common project tasks (`just start`, `just stop`, `just logs`, `just rebuild`).
    *   **Discoverability:** Running `just` or `just --list` shows all available commands defined in the `justfile`.
    *   **Simplicity:** `just` is designed to avoid some of the complexities and historical baggage of `make` [[Source: casey/just GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just)]. The syntax is generally straightforward.
    *   **Organization:** Keeps all the common operational commands organized in one place. You could add recipes for cleaning data, updating images, running specific checks, etc.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Recipes can depend on each other (like `rebuild` depending on `stop` in the example).

3.  **Compared to Current State:**
    *   Currently, you have one primary script (`start-services.sh`) for the complex startup/check/open process. `just` would primarily act as a wrapper around this script initially.
    *   The main advantage comes when you add *more* management tasks beyond just starting. Instead of having multiple `.sh` scripts or remembering long `docker-compose` commands, you put them in the `justfile`.

**Recommendation:**

Using `just` here would be a good way to standardize project commands, especially if you anticipate adding more management tasks (like stopping, cleaning, viewing logs, rebuilding). It provides a clean interface (`just start`) instead of executing the script directly (`./start-services.sh`).

It's generally a matter of preference over using `make` or just relying on standalone scripts. If you like the idea of a dedicated file listing all project commands and want something potentially simpler than `make`, `just` is a solid option [[Source: casey/just GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just)]. The main "cost" is adding `just` as a development dependency for anyone working on the project.

_**User**_

Implement a management system using the just command runner that implements what you mentioned (stopping, cleaning, viewing logs, rebuilding) plus anything more that you see fit and necessary

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I will create a `justfile` in the root of your workspace to manage the Docker Compose application using `just`.

This file will include recipes for starting, stopping, cleaning (stopping + removing volumes), viewing logs (all or specific services), rebuilding images, checking status, and running the GPU check.

```

I have created the `justfile` in your workspace root.

You can now use commands like:

*   `just` or `just start`: Starts services using your `start-services.sh` script (includes GPU check, health checks, browser opening).
*   `just stop`: Stops the running containers.
*   `just down`: Stops and removes containers/networks (keeps data volumes).
*   `just clean`: Stops and removes containers, networks, *and* data volumes.
*   `just logs`: Tails logs from all services.
*   `just logs ollama`: Tails logs specifically for the `ollama` service.
*   `just rebuild`: Rebuilds images and restarts containers (note: this uses `docker-compose up -d` directly, bypassing the `start-services.sh` checks).
*   `just status`: Shows the status of your Docker Compose services.
*   `just pull`: Pulls the latest images for the services.
*   `just check-gpu`: Runs the NVIDIA GPU check separately.

Make sure you have `just` installed to use this file. You can find installation instructions at [just.systems](https://just.systems/) or its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/casey/just).

I get this error when running just using the @justfile:

error: Recipe `check-gpu` failed on line 11 with exit code 2

Explain what causes this error and how to fix it

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, let's analyze that error.

**Cause of the Error:**

The error `Recipe check-gpu failed on line 11 with exit code 2` points to the `fi` line of your `check-gpu` recipe. Exit code 2 from `/bin/sh` (which `just` usually invokes) typically indicates a **syntax error** or **misuse of shell builtins**.

The problem likely lies in how `just` interprets the multi-line shell command constructed using the backslash (`\\`) line continuations. While the intention is to create a single command `if ... then ... else ... fi` to pass to the shell, subtle interactions between `just`'s parsing and the shell's parsing of this multi-line structure can lead to the shell receiving a malformed command, resulting in a syntax error when it reaches the `fi`.

**How to Fix It:**

The most reliable way to fix this is to put the entire shell conditional logic onto a *single* line within the `justfile`. This removes the need for line continuations (`\\`) and ensures the shell receives a standard, unambiguous command string.

I will apply this fix to your `justfile`.

```diff
  # Check for NVIDIA GPU availability
  check-gpu:
-     @if command -v nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then \\
-         echo "NVIDIA GPU detected:"; \\
-         nvidia-smi; \\
-     else \\
-         echo "WARNING: NVIDIA GPU not detected. GPU acceleration may not be available."; \\
-     fi
+     @if command -v nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then echo "NVIDIA GPU detected:"; nvidia-smi; else echo "WARNING: NVIDIA GPU not detected. GPU acceleration may not be available."; fi
  
  # Start all services using the helper script (includes health checks and browser opening)
```

---

I've updated the `check-gpu` recipe in your `justfile` to use a single line for the `if` statement. This should resolve the exit code 2 error.

_**User**_

runninng `just start` will start all containers except ollama where it just repeatedly echos "Waiting for Ollama to be ready..."

What would be the issue causing this and how can I fix it?
