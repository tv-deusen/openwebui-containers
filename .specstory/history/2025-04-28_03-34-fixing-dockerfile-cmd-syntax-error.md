# Fixing Dockerfile CMD Syntax Error (2025-04-28 10:34:37)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unknown instruction: CMD["NPM",
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Just add a space between the instruction and its JSON-array args. For example, in `uptime-kuma/Dockerfile` change:

```dockerfile
# ← wrong:
CMD["npm", "run", "start"]
```

to

```dockerfile
# ← fixed:
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

_**User**_

Will this `apk add` command work for this specific uptime-kuma docker image
