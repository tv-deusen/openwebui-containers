# Diagnosing Open Web UI Connection Issues (2025-04-28 11:03:17)

_**User**_

I am getting an error from open web UI after running just start. It cannot connect to the container running ollama. What can I use to diagnose the issue?

_**Assistant**_

Here are a few quick ways to triage an “open-webui can’t reach ollama” problem:

1. Check service status & logs  
   - `docker-compose ps`  
     • Are both containers “Up”?  
   - `docker-compose logs ollama`  
   - `docker-compose logs open-webui`  

2. Test name‐based networking from inside the web-UI container  
   ```bash
   # Shell into the open-webui container
   docker-compose exec open-webui sh

   # 1) Ping the ollama hostname
   ping -c3 ollama

   # 2) Curl the API endpoint
   curl -v http://ollama:11434/v1/models
   ```
   If ping/name‐resolution fails, or curl hangs/fails, you’ve isolated it to Docker’s network.

3. Inspect the Docker network  
   ```bash
   docker network inspect ai-network
   ```  
   • Confirm both containers are attached.  
   • Look at the IP for “ollama” vs. what the open-webui logs report.

4. Verify the environment variable inside open-webui  
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec open-webui sh -c 'echo $OLLAMA_API_BASE'
   ```  
   It should read exactly `http://ollama:11434`.

5. (Optional) Port‐mapping / firewall  
   If you’re using a custom firewall/SELinux, make sure Docker’s bridge ports aren’t blocked.  

By combining logs, an in-container ping/curl and a network inspect, you’ll know whether it’s a DNS-resolution issue, a routing hiccup, or an actual API failure.

The in-container pings worked and so did the `   docker-compose exec open-webui sh -c 'echo $OLLAMA_API_BASE'`  what else could be the issue? how do I check the logs for both containers?

Okay, since the basic network checks (ping, correct environment variable) passed, the issue likely lies within the services themselves or their interaction at the application level.

Here's how to check the logs for both containers:

1.  **View Ollama logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs ollama
    ```
    *   **Look for:** Error messages related to startup, API requests failing, model loading issues, or GPU problems (if configured).

2.  **View Open WebUI logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs open-webui
    ```
    *   **Look for:** Specific errors when it tries to connect to `http://ollama:11434`. This might include connection refused errors (even if ping worked, the service might not be listening correctly), timeouts, or HTTP error codes (like 4xx or 5xx) returned by the Ollama API.

3.  **View combined logs (useful for timing):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs --follow
    ```
    This will show logs from both containers in real-time, which can help see if an action in Open WebUI immediately causes an error in Ollama. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following.

Check those logs for any specific error messages around the time you experienced the connection problem in the Open WebUI interface. Paste any relevant error lines here if you'd like help interpreting them.
