# Troubleshooting Ollama Service Startup Issues (2025-04-29 23:27:48)

_**User**_

When running just start, it seems like theres issues in the shell script and the ollama service is not starting. What might be wrong?

---

_**Assistant**_

To troubleshoot the issue with the `just start` command and the `ollama` service not starting, we can look at a few potential areas of concern based on the provided `justfile` and `start-services.sh` script.

1. **Check Docker Daemon**: Ensure that the Docker daemon is running. The `check-docker` command in your `justfile` should handle this, but you can manually verify by running `docker info`.

2. **NVIDIA GPU Availability**: The `ollama` service requires an NVIDIA GPU. The `check-gpu` command checks for GPU availability. If the GPU is not detected, the service may not start. You can run `nvidia-smi` directly in your terminal to confirm that the GPU is available.

3. **Health Check Logic**: The `start-services.sh` script includes a health check for the `ollama` service. If the service is not ready, the script will keep waiting. The relevant part of the script is:
   ```bash
   until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://ollama:11434/api/tags >/dev/null 2>&1; do
     echo "Waiting for Ollama to be ready..."
     sleep 2
   done
   ```
   If `ollama` is not starting correctly, this check will fail, and you will see the "Waiting for Ollama to be ready..." message repeatedly.

4. **Logs**: Check the logs for the `ollama` service to see if there are any error messages that could indicate why it is not starting. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs ollama
   ```

5. **Docker Compose Configuration**: Ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured for the `ollama` service, including the necessary environment variables and GPU configuration. If there are any issues in the configuration, the service may fail to start.

6. **Service Dependencies**: Make sure that the `ollama` service is defined correctly in your `docker-compose.yml` and that it is set to start before the `open-webui` service, as per your service dependency rules.

If you can provide the logs from the `ollama` service or any error messages you are seeing, that would help narrow down the issue further.

_**Assistant**_

Based on the logs from the `ollama` service, it appears that the service is starting up correctly and is able to detect the NVIDIA GPU. Here are some key points from the logs:

1. **Key Generation**: The log indicates that a new private key is being generated because it couldn't find an existing one. This is normal behavior if the key does not exist.

2. **Server Configuration**: The server is configured and is listening on port `11434`, which is the expected behavior.

3. **GPU Detection**: The log shows that the service has successfully detected the NVIDIA GPU:
   ```
   msg="inference compute" id=GPU-75475875-dd58-d07d-464d-5663d0792e29 library=cuda variant=v12 compute=8.6 driver=12.8 name="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU" total="5.7 GiB" available="4.9 GiB"
   ```

4. **No Errors Indicated**: There are no error messages in the logs, which suggests that the `ollama` service is running as expected.

### Next Steps

Since the `ollama` service appears to be running correctly, the issue may lie in the health check logic in the `start-services.sh` script. Here are a few things to check:

1. **Health Check URL**: Ensure that the health check URL being used in the `start-services.sh` script is correct. The script checks:
   ```bash
   until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://ollama:11434/api/tags >/dev/null 2>&1; do
   ```
   Make sure that the `/api/tags` endpoint is valid and accessible. You can test this manually by running:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://ollama:11434/api/tags
   ```
   If this command fails, it may indicate that the endpoint is not available or that there is a networking issue.

2. **Network Configuration**: Ensure that both the `open-webui` and `ollama` services are on the same Docker network (which should be the case if they are defined in the same `docker-compose.yml` file).

3. **Service Dependencies**: Verify that the `ollama` service is defined correctly in your `docker-compose.yml` and that it starts before the `open-webui` service, as per your service dependency rules.

If the health check fails, it could be due to the `ollama` service not being fully ready to respond to requests, even though it is running. You might want to add some additional logging or a delay in the health check to give the service more time to initialize.

There is an issue with the start script where running `just start` infinitely loops waiting for Ollama to be ready. Check over the files to see if there are any logic issues or anything wrong with regards to starting the Ollama service. The docker compose log output for the ollama service showed that it was fine, but the script got stuck

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the issue with your scripts that's causing the infinite loop when waiting for Ollama. I'll check the relevant files to identify the problem.

---

Read file: start-services.sh

---

I've found the issue with your `start-services.sh` script. The problem is in the health check logic for Ollama. Let me examine the docker-compose.yml file to confirm the network setup as well.

---

```bash
docker compose ps
```

```
╰─$ docker compose ps                                                   23:32:34
NAME      IMAGE     COMMAND   SERVICE   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[23:32:35]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                     23:32:35
```

---

I see the issue now. When analyzing the `start-services.sh` file and comparing it with your `docker-compose.yml`, I found the problem that's causing the infinite loop:

1. In the `start-services.sh` file, you're attempting to use a health check that executes the curl command from within the `open-webui` container to check if Ollama is ready:
   ```bash
   until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://ollama:11434/api/tags >/dev/null 2>&1; do
     echo "Waiting for Ollama to be ready..."
     sleep 2
   done
   ```

2. The issue is that this check is run immediately after starting the services with `docker compose up -d`. However, according to your `docker-compose.yml`, the `open-webui` service depends on the health of the `ollama` service before it even starts:
   ```yaml
   depends_on:
     ollama:
       condition: service_healthy
   ```

This creates a circular dependency:
- Your script waits for the `open-webui` container to be available to run a curl command to check if `ollama` is ready
- But the `open-webui` container won't start until `ollama` is already healthy

Let's fix this by editing the `start-services.sh` file:
