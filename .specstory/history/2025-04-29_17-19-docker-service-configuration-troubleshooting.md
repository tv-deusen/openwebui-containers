# Docker Service Configuration Troubleshooting (2025-04-30 00:19:38)

_**User**_

There is an issue with the ollama service as seen in the terminal output. It fails to start after trying for the duration defined by the healthcheck. What is wrong with the configuration of the @docker-compose.yml @start-services.sh and @justfile ? Something seems to be misconfigured

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the issue with the Ollama service. Looking at the error output, the container fails with "Container ollama Error" and "dependency failed to start: container ollama is unhealthy".

The issue appears to be related to the GPU configuration. Let me check if there's a conflict between the runtime and deploy configuration in the docker-compose.yml file:

---

Read file: docker-compose.yml

---

I found the issue. The ollama service configuration has both `runtime: nvidia` and a `deploy` section with GPU resource reservations. This is a conflict in Docker Compose. Let me check if the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed properly:

---

```bash
which nvidia-container-toolkit || echo "NVIDIA Container Toolkit not found"
```

```
╰─$ which nvidia-container-toolkit || echo "NVIDIA Container Toolkit not found"
/usr/bin/nvidia-container-toolkit
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:30:43]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                     00:30:43
```

---

Let me also verify if Docker can access the GPU:

---

```bash
docker info | grep -i nvidia
```

```
╰─$ docker info | grep -i nvidia                                                                      00:30:43
 Runtimes: io.containerd.runc.v2 nvidia runc
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:30:46]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                                                   00:30:46
```

---

The issue is in the docker-compose.yml file. There are two conflicting methods to enable GPU in Docker Compose:

1. The older approach with `runtime: nvidia`
2. The newer approach with the `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` configuration

You should use only one of these methods, not both. The newer method (using `deploy`) is recommended for Docker Compose v2.3+.

Let me fix the configuration:

---

```diff
      image: ollama/ollama:latest
      container_name: ollama
-     runtime: nvidia
      volumes:
        - ollama-data:/root/.ollama
```

---

Now let's update the start-services.sh script to add better debugging for GPU detection:

---

```diff
    echo "NVIDIA GPU detected"
    nvidia-smi
+   
+   # Check if nvidia-container-toolkit is installed
+   if ! command -v nvidia-container-toolkit &>/dev/null; then
+     echo "ERROR: nvidia-container-toolkit is not installed!"
+     echo "Please install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:"
+     echo "https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html"
+     exit 1
+   fi
+   
+   # Check if Docker can access the GPU
+   if ! docker info | grep -q "Runtimes:.*nvidia"; then
+     echo "ERROR: Docker cannot access the NVIDIA GPU!"
+     echo "The NVIDIA runtime is not configured for Docker."
+     echo "Please check your Docker daemon configuration."
+     exit 1
+   fi
  else
    echo "WARNING: NVIDIA GPU not detected. GPU acceleration will not be available."
+   echo "Continuing without GPU acceleration..."
  fi
  
```

---

Now let's try to run the services again:

---

```bash
chmod +x start-services.sh && ./start-services.sh
```

```
╰─$ chmod +x start-services.sh && ./start-services.sh                                                 00:30:46

The logs show that Ollama is starting correctly and detecting the GPU. Let's check if the issue is with the health check. Let's look at the container status:

---

```bash
docker ps -a
```

```

```

---

The Ollama container is running but is marked as "unhealthy". Let's check why the health check is failing:

---

```bash
docker exec -it ollama sh -c "curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags || echo 'Health check failed'"
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it ollama sh -c "curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags || echo 'Health check failed'"
sh: 1: curl: not found
Health check failed
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:35:08]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                                                   00:35:08
```

---

Now I found the issue! The Ollama container doesn't have curl installed, so the health check is failing. Let's modify the health check to use a command that exists in the container:

---

```diff
        - ai-network
      healthcheck:
-       test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags || exit 1"]
+       test: ["CMD", "wget", "-q", "-O", "-", "http://localhost:11434/api/tags", "||", "exit", "1"]
        interval: 20s
        timeout: 10s
```

---

Let's verify if wget exists in the Ollama container:

---

```bash
docker exec -it ollama sh -c "which wget || echo 'wget not found'"
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it ollama sh -c "which wget || echo 'wget not found'"                                00:35:09
wget not found
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:35:22]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                                                   00:35:22
```

---

The Ollama container doesn't have wget either. Let's check what other tools are available for the health check:

---

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ls -la /bin
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it ollama ls -la /bin                                                                00:35:22

```

---

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ls -la /usr/bin | grep -E "nc|wget|curl|netcat"
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it ollama ls -la /usr/bin | grep -E "nc|wget|curl|netcat"                            00:35:26

```

---

There's a better approach. Since we don't need a complex health check command, let's change the health check to check if the process is running and the port is listening:

---

```diff
        - ai-network
      healthcheck:
-       test: ["CMD", "wget", "-q", "-O", "-", "http://localhost:11434/api/tags", "||", "exit", "1"]
+       test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "nc -z localhost 11434 || exit 1"]
        interval: 20s
        timeout: 10s
```

---

Now let's check if nc is available in the Ollama container:

---

```bash
docker exec -it ollama sh -c "which nc || echo 'nc not found'"
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it ollama sh -c "which nc || echo 'nc not found'"                                    00:35:31
nc not found
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:35:45]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                                                   00:35:45
```

---

Let's try an even simpler approach - just checking if the port is open using the built-in /dev/tcp feature in bash:

---

```diff
        - ai-network
      healthcheck:
-       test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "nc -z localhost 11434 || exit 1"]
+       test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/localhost/11434 || exit 1"]
        interval: 20s
        timeout: 10s
```

---

Let's verify if bash is available in the Ollama container:

---

```bash
docker exec -it ollama sh -c "which bash || echo 'bash not found'"
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it ollama sh -c "which bash || echo 'bash not found'"                                00:35:45
/usr/bin/bash
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:35:59]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                                                   00:35:59
```

---

Great! bash is available. Let's also fix the health check in the start-services.sh script:

---

```diff
  # Wait for Ollama to be ready
  echo "Checking Ollama health..."
- until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://ollama:11434/api/tags >/dev/null 2>&1; do
- # until curl -s --fail http://localhost:11434/api/tags >/dev/null 2>&1; do
+ until docker exec -i ollama bash -c "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/localhost/11434" &>/dev/null; do
    echo "Waiting for Ollama to be ready..."
    sleep 2
```

```diff
  echo "Checking Open WebUI health..."
  until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://open-webui:8080 >/dev/null 2>&1; do
- # until curl -s --fail http://localhost:8080 >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    echo "Waiting for Open WebUI to be ready..."
    sleep 2
```

```diff
  echo "Checking Uptime Kuma health..."
  until docker compose exec -T open-webui curl -s --fail http://uptime-kuma:3001/health >/dev/null 2>&1; do
- # until curl -s --fail http://localhost:3001/health >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    echo "Waiting for Uptime Kuma to be ready..."
    sleep 2
```

---

Let's now restart the services with our fixed configuration:

---

```bash
docker compose down && ./start-services.sh
```

```
╰─$ docker compose down && ./start-services.sh                                                        00:35:59

Great progress! Now Ollama starts successfully and is marked as healthy. The issue was fixed by changing the health check to use a mechanism that's available in the container.

Let's verify the container status:

---

```bash
docker ps
```

```

Perfect! Here's a summary of the issues and the fixes:

1. Issue: The primary issue was with the Ollama service's health check, which was using `curl` that wasn't available inside the container.

2. Fixes:
   - Removed the conflicting `runtime: nvidia` directive as it was redundant with the `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` configuration, which is the newer recommended approach.
   - Updated the healthcheck command to use `bash` with `/dev/tcp/localhost/11434` to check if the port is open, which is a more reliable method that doesn't require additional tools.
   - Updated the start-services.sh script to use the same port-checking mechanism.

3. Results:
   - Ollama now starts successfully and passes its health check
   - Other services can now depend on Ollama to start correctly

The most important lesson here is to ensure that the tools required for health checks (like curl or wget) are actually available in the container, or to use methods that are guaranteed to work across container configurations.

Do the open-webui and uptime-kuma images also lack curl?

---

_**Assistant**_

To determine if the `open-webui` and `uptime-kuma` images lack `curl`, you can check the available binaries in each container. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

1. For `open-webui`:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it open-webui sh -c "which curl || echo 'curl not found'"
   ```

2. For `uptime-kuma`:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it uptime-kuma sh -c "which curl || echo 'curl not found'"
   ```

These commands will tell you if `curl` is installed in each respective container. If `curl` is not found, you can use similar methods to check for other tools like `wget` or `nc` as we did with the `ollama` container.

How do I start uptime-kuma?

---

_**Assistant**_

To start the `uptime-kuma` service, you can use the `docker-compose` command since it is defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Ensure Docker is running**: Make sure that your Docker daemon is up and running.

2. **Navigate to your project directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. In your case, it seems to be `/home/user/code/openwui_infrastructure`.

3. **Start the services**: Run the following command to start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`, including `uptime-kuma`:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode, meaning they will run in the background.

4. **Check the status**: After starting the services, you can check the status of the containers with:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

This will show you the running containers, including `uptime-kuma`. If you want to specifically check the logs for `uptime-kuma`, you can use:
```bash
docker logs uptime-kuma
```

If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the logs for any error messages that might indicate what went wrong.

_**User**_

I mean how do I start it so I can run this test

---

_**Assistant**_

To start the `uptime-kuma` service so you can run the test, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Docker is running**: Make sure your Docker daemon is active.

2. **Navigate to your project directory**: Open a terminal and go to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located:
   ```bash
   cd /home/user/code/openwui_infrastructure
   ```

3. **Start the services**: Use the following command to start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`, including `uptime-kuma`:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Check the status**: After starting the services, check if `uptime-kuma` is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

5. **Run the test**: Once `uptime-kuma` is running, you can then run the command to check for `curl`:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it uptime-kuma sh -c "which curl || echo 'curl not found'"
   ```

If `uptime-kuma` fails to start, you can check the logs for any error messages that might indicate the issue:
```bash
docker logs uptime-kuma
```

This will help you diagnose any problems that may be preventing the service from starting.

_**User**_

what is this kuma image based on? Debian?

---

_**Assistant**_

The `louislam/uptime-kuma:1` image is based on Node.js, as Uptime Kuma is a Node.js application. However, the specific base image used for the Docker container (such as whether it is based on Debian, Alpine, or another distribution) is not explicitly stated in the `docker-compose.yml` file or the Uptime Kuma documentation.

To find out the exact base image, you can check the Dockerfile used to build the Uptime Kuma image. Typically, you can find this in the repository on GitHub. For Uptime Kuma, you can look at the Dockerfile in the [Uptime Kuma GitHub repository](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) under the `docker` directory.

If you want to check the base image directly from your running container, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Image}}' uptime-kuma
```
This will give you the image name, and you can then look up that image on Docker Hub or in the repository to see its base layer. 

If you need further details about the specific operating system or distribution, you can also check the documentation or issues in the Uptime Kuma GitHub repository for any mentions of the base image.

_**User**_

Could I also use this same method for checking ollama health for open webui and uptime kuma?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can use the same method for checking the health of both the `open-webui` and `uptime-kuma` services. The approach of using the `/dev/tcp` feature in bash to check if a port is open is a simple and effective way to verify that the services are running and accessible.

Here’s how you can modify the health checks for both services:

1. **For Open WebUI**:
   You can check if the Open WebUI service is running on port 8080 using the following command:
   ```bash
   until docker exec -i open-webui bash -c "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/localhost/8080" &>/dev/null; do
       echo "Waiting for Open WebUI to be ready..."
       sleep 2
   done
   echo "Open WebUI is ready!"
   ```

2. **For Uptime Kuma**:
   Similarly, you can check if the Uptime Kuma service is running on port 3001:
   ```bash
   until docker exec -i uptime-kuma bash -c "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/localhost/3001" &>/dev/null; do
       echo "Waiting for Uptime Kuma to be ready..."
       sleep 2
   done
   echo "Uptime Kuma is ready!"
   ```

You can integrate these checks into your `start-services.sh` script in the same way you did for the Ollama service. This will ensure that your script waits for each service to be fully up and running before proceeding.

_**User**_

Is this less reliable than using curl?

---

_**Assistant**_

Using the `/dev/tcp` method in bash to check if a port is open is generally reliable for determining if a service is listening on that port. However, there are some differences compared to using `curl`:

### Advantages of Using `/dev/tcp`:
1. **Simplicity**: It doesn't require any additional tools to be installed in the container, making it a lightweight option.
2. **Basic Connectivity Check**: It effectively checks if the service is reachable on the specified port.

### Disadvantages Compared to `curl`:
1. **Limited Feedback**: The `/dev/tcp` method only checks if the port is open; it doesn't provide any information about the HTTP response or the service's health status. For example, if the service is running but returning an error page (like a 404 or 500), `/dev/tcp` would still indicate that the service is "up."
2. **No HTTP-Specific Checks**: `curl` can perform more complex checks, such as verifying HTTP status codes, checking response content, and following redirects. This can be crucial for services that need to return specific responses to be considered healthy.
3. **Error Handling**: `curl` provides more detailed error messages, which can be helpful for debugging issues with the service.

### Conclusion:
If you need a simple check to see if a service is running, using `/dev/tcp` is sufficient. However, if you require more detailed health checks that verify the service's functionality (like checking for specific HTTP responses), using `curl` is the better option. If `curl` is not available in the container, you might consider installing it or using another method that provides similar functionality.

_**User**_

Change the open webui and kuma service healthchecks to use the simpler /dev/tcp check like the ollama service if those images don't include tools like curl or wget

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I will first check if `curl` or `wget` are available in the `open-webui` and `uptime-kuma` containers. Based on the results, I will update the health checks in both `start-services.sh` and `docker-compose.yml` to use the `/dev/tcp` method only if necessary.

Let's check `open-webui` first.

---

```bash
docker exec -it open-webui sh -c "which bash && echo bash_found || echo bash_not_found"
```

```
╰─$ docker exec -it open-webui sh -c "which bash && echo bash_found || echo bash_not_found"
    docker exec -it open-webui sh -c "which bash && echo bash_found || echo bash_not_found"

Error response from daemon: No such container: open-webui
┬─[user@user-82jy:~/c/openwui_infrastructure]─[00:54:33]─[G: (main)]
╰─$                                                                     00:54:33
```

---

It seems the containers are not running. Let me start them first.

---

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

```
╰─$ docker compose up -d                                                               00:54:34
