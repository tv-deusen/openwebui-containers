Explain the differences between merge, rebase, and fast-forward only

_**Assistant**_

In Git, when you pull changes from a remote repository, you can choose how to reconcile divergent branches using three main strategies: merge, rebase, and fast-forward only. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

### 1. Merge
- **Description**: This strategy combines the changes from the remote branch into your current branch by creating a new commit (a "merge commit"). It preserves the history of both branches.
- **Use Case**: Use merge when you want to maintain the complete history of changes and see how branches diverged and converged over time.
- **Command**: 
  ```bash
  git config pull.rebase false
  ```

### 2. Rebase
- **Description**: Rebase moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It rewrites the commit history by applying your changes on top of the changes from the remote branch, resulting in a linear history.
- **Use Case**: Use rebase when you want a cleaner, linear project history without merge commits. This is particularly useful for feature branches before merging them into the main branch.
- **Command**: 
  ```bash
  git config pull.rebase true
  ```

### 3. Fast-Forward Only
- **Description**: This strategy only allows the pull to succeed if the current branch can be "fast-forwarded" to the remote branch. This means that there are no divergent changes; your branch is simply behind the remote branch.
- **Use Case**: Use fast-forward only when you want to ensure that your branch history remains linear and you do not want to create merge commits. This is often used in collaborative environments to keep the history clean.
- **Command**: 
  ```bash
  git config pull.ff only
  ```

### Summary
- **Merge**: Creates a merge commit, preserving history.
- **Rebase**: Rewrites history for a linear commit structure.
- **Fast-Forward Only**: Only updates if there are no divergent changes, ensuring a linear history without merge commits.

You can set your preferred strategy globally or per repository using the `--global` flag with the `git config` command.
