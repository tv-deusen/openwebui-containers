# Ensuring Ollama Uses Discrete GPU in Docker (2025-04-28 18:51:12)

_**User**_

What tools can I use to ensure that Ollama is utilizing my discrete GPU while it runs in its docker container?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Okay, the user is asking about tools to ensure Ollama uses their discrete GPU in a Docker container. Let me start by recalling the setup. They have a docker-compose.yml with Ollama service, right? The required instructions mention GPU configuration with NVIDIA drivers.

First, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is essential. It allows Docker containers to access the GPU. I should mention installing that. Then, checking if the GPU is visible inside the container. Commands like nvidia-smi inside the container would help. Maybe suggest running docker exec to execute that.

Next, Ollama has a command to list the GPU resources it detects. So, ollama serve --verbose or ollama list might show GPU info. Also, the OLLAMA_GPU_LAYERS environment variable can force using GPU layers.

Logs are important too. Checking Ollama's logs for GPU-related messages would indicate if it's using the GPU. Maybe tailing the logs after making a request.

The user's verify-gpu.sh script might need a check for NVIDIA drivers and the container toolkit. Updating that script could help automate verification.

I should also reference their docker-compose.yml to ensure the deploy section with GPU capabilities is correctly set. Maybe they have that already, but it's worth confirming.

Putting it all together, the tools include the NVIDIA toolkit, Docker commands, Ollama's own commands, log checks, and their existing scripts. Make sure each step is clear and actionable.
</think>

To verify Ollama's GPU utilization in Docker, use these diagnostic tools and methods:

1. **NVIDIA Container Toolkit Validation**
```bash
# Check toolkit installation
nvidia-ctk --version

# Verify GPU visibility in container
docker exec ollama nvidia-smi -L
```

2. **Ollama GPU Detection Check**
```bash
# Check available GPU resources from Ollama's perspective
docker exec ollama ollama list
docker exec ollama ollama serve --verbose
```

3. **Environment Configuration (update your docker-compose.yml if missing):**
```yaml:docker-compose.yml
services:
  ollama:
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_GPU_LAYERS=100  # Force GPU layer utilization
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

4. **Performance Monitoring Tools**
```bash
# Real-time GPU utilization (host machine)
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Container-specific metrics
docker stats ollama
```

5. **Log Analysis**
```bash
# Check Ollama container logs for GPU initialization
docker logs ollama | grep -i 'gpu|cuda'

# Monitor model loading behavior
docker exec ollama tail -f /usr/local/bin/ollama_logs.txt
```

6. **Benchmark Test**
```bash
# Compare processing speed with/without GPU
docker exec ollama ollama run llama2 "Benchmark test" > cpu.txt
docker exec --env OLLAMA_GPU_LAYERS=100 ollama ollama run llama2 "Benchmark test" > gpu.txt
```

For your existing infrastructure, you can enhance the `verify-gpu.sh` script with these checks. Would you like me to propose specific updates to your verification script?

It looks like the ollama container isn't able to utilize my Nvidia GPU based on checking the logs in step 5. What can I do to resolve this?

_**Assistant**_

Okay, those logs clearly indicate that the Ollama process inside the container cannot detect the NVIDIA GPU, even though the CUDA library seems present (`libcuda.so.570.144`).

This usually points to an issue with the **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** setup on your host machine, which is responsible for making the GPU accessible to Docker containers.

Here's how to troubleshoot:

1.  **Verify NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation & Service:**
    *   Open a terminal on your host machine (not inside the container) and run:
        ```bash
        nvidia-ctk --version
        # Check if the runtime service is active (command might vary slightly based on Linux distro)
        sudo systemctl status nvidia-container-runtime.service
        ```
    *   If `nvidia-ctk` is not found or the service is inactive/failed, you'll need to install or repair the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. Follow the official installation guide for your distribution: [https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

2.  **Verify Host NVIDIA Drivers:**
    *   Confirm your host machine can see the GPU and the drivers are working correctly:
        ```bash
        nvidia-smi
        ```
    *   Ensure your drivers are reasonably up-to-date and compatible with the toolkit.

3.  **Test Basic GPU Container Access:**
    *   Try running a simple container that uses the GPU. This helps isolate whether the issue is specific to Ollama or a general Docker/GPU problem:
        ```bash
        docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
        ```
    *   If this command fails with errors related to the NVIDIA runtime or cannot find `nvidia-smi`, the problem lies in your host's Docker/NVIDIA configuration. If it succeeds and shows your GPU, the issue might be more specific to the Ollama container setup (though less likely given the logs).

4.  **Restart Docker Daemon:**
    *   Sometimes a simple restart can resolve issues:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart docker
        ```

5.  **Recreate Ollama Container:**
    *   After verifying/fixing the host setup, remove the existing Ollama container and start it again to ensure it uses the correct runtime configuration:
        ```bash
        docker compose down
        docker compose up -d ollama
        ```
    *   Check the logs again (`docker logs ollama`) after it starts.

Start with step 1 (NVIDIA Container Toolkit verification) as it's the most common culprit. Let me know what you find!

_**User**_

the command `systemctl status nvidia-container-runtime.service` shows that this service is not installed on my machine, but as you can see in @bash I am able to utilize the GPU inside the docker container. What could be wrong?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, that's a useful data point! The fact that `docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda... nvidia-smi` works correctly proves:

1.  Your NVIDIA drivers on the host are functional.
2.  Docker *is* configured correctly to use the NVIDIA runtime when the `--gpus` flag is provided, allowing basic containers to access the GPU.

The absence of the `nvidia-container-runtime.service` might mean your distribution or setup manages the NVIDIA runtime integration with Docker differently, perhaps directly configuring Docker's daemon (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) to use the `nvidia` runtime without needing that specific systemd service wrapper. This is valid in newer setups.

So, the general Docker-GPU bridge is working, but the Ollama container specifically fails to initialize the GPU, according to its logs: `"no nvidia devices detected by library /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.570.144"`.

This points the finger towards an issue *within* the Ollama container environment or its interaction with the host driver/runtime, even though the devices are being passed through. Here are the next things to check:

1.  **Docker Daemon Configuration:** Let's see how Docker is configured to handle GPUs. Please show the contents of your Docker daemon configuration file:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
    ```
    *(Look for `"default-runtime": "nvidia"` or entries under `"runtimes": { "nvidia": { ... } }`)*

2.  **Ollama Container Runtime Details:** Let's verify exactly how the Ollama container was launched regarding the GPU runtime. Ensure the container is running and then execute:
    ```bash
    docker inspect ollama | jq '.[0].HostConfig.Runtime'
    # If jq isn't installed, try:
    # docker inspect ollama --format '{{.HostConfig.Runtime}}'
    ```
    This should ideally show `nvidia` or be empty if using the default runtime (which should be configured as `nvidia` in `daemon.json`).

3.  **Driver/Toolkit Compatibility:** Although the basic CUDA container worked, there might be a subtle incompatibility between the specific Ollama version, the CUDA version it expects/bundles, and your host driver (570.144).
    *   Check the Ollama documentation or GitHub issues for any known compatibility problems with NVIDIA driver 570.x.
    *   Try specifying an older Ollama image tag in your `docker-compose.yml` if you suspect a recent regression, e.g., `image: ollama/ollama:0.1.41` (check Docker Hub for recent tags).

4.  **Recreate with Explicit Runtime (Less Likely Needed):** While `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` is the modern way, you *could* explicitly try setting the runtime in your `docker-compose.yml` as a test, though it might conflict if `daemon.json` is already set:
    ```diff
     ollama:
       image: ollama/ollama:latest
       container_name: ollama
    +  runtime: nvidia # Add this line
       volumes:
         - ollama-data:/root/.ollama
    ```
    Then run `docker compose down && docker compose up -d ollama`.

Let's start with the output of `cat /etc/docker/daemon.json` and `docker inspect ollama`.

_**User**_

For step 1 you can see in Lines 2-8 in @bash   that the daemon config is okay, but Lines 9-10 show the incorrect runtime.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, you've found the mismatch!

*   Your Docker daemon (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) knows about the `nvidia` runtime.
*   However, the `docker inspect` command shows the `ollama` container is currently using `runc`, the standard OCI runtime, which cannot access the GPU capabilities provided by the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

This means that despite using the `deploy` key with device reservations in your `docker-compose.yml`, Docker Compose didn't automatically select the required `nvidia` runtime. The `deploy` key often handles this, but sometimes explicit configuration is needed, especially depending on Docker and Compose versions.

**The Solution:**

Explicitly tell the `ollama` service in your `docker-compose.yml` to use the `nvidia` runtime you have defined in `daemon.json`.

**Proposed Change to `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
name: mylittlellm

services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    container_name: ollama
+   runtime: nvidia # <-- Add this line
    volumes:
      - ollama-data:/root/.ollama
    ports:
// ... rest of ollama service definition ...
```

**Next Steps:**

1.  Add the `runtime: nvidia` line to your `docker-compose.yml` under the `ollama` service as shown above.
2.  Stop and remove the existing container, then start it again with the updated configuration:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d ollama
    ```
3.  Once the container is running, check the logs again:
    ```bash
    docker logs ollama
    ```

You should now see logs indicating successful GPU detection and initialization. Let me know the outcome!

Yes, absolutely! That log output confirms success.
