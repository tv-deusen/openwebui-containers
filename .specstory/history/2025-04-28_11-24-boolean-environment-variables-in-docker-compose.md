# Boolean Environment Variables in Docker Compose (2025-04-28 18:24:22)

_**User**_

Does case matter for setting boolean environment variables in @docker-compose.yml ? Or are true and false ok as well?

---

_**Assistant**_

In Docker Compose the only places where “boolean” values are really treated as YAML booleans are the Compose-file fields themselves (e.g. `tty: true`, `restart: unless-stopped`, etc.).  Those follow the normal YAML rules, which are case-insensitive for the keywords `true`/`false` (you’ll see `True`, `TRUE`, `yes`, `on` and so on all treated as boolean “true”).

However, anything you put under the `environment:` section is always passed into your container as a _string_.  Docker Compose does not turn environment-section values into native booleans in the container—whatever text you write is what your application will see.  

– If you write:
```yaml
    environment:
      - DISABLE_AUTH=true
```
Compose will hand your container the string `"true"`.  
– If you write:
```yaml
    environment:
      - ENABLE_SIGNUP=False
```
Compose will hand your container the string `"False"`.

Whether your service treats `"true"`, `"True"`, `"1"` or `"yes"` as its “on” value is entirely up to that service’s own configuration parser.  The safe default is:

  • use lowercase `true`/`false` (or whatever the docs for that image tell you)  
  • or explicitly quote them if you want to be absolutely certain you’re passing a string:
  
```yaml
    environment:
      - DISABLE_AUTH="true"
      - ENABLE_SIGNUP="false"
```

In short:  
 1. Compose-file booleans (outside of `environment:`) are YAML scalars and case-insensitive.  
 2. Under `environment:` you’re always just setting strings—case matters only insofar as your application’s parser is strict.
